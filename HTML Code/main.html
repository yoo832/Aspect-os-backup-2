      Welcome to the Official AspectOS Website! This website is for people who
      want to learn about AspectOS. This website also covers past and future
      updates for our OS. Before I get into the details, you need to know who we
      are and what we do.

    <h1>
      About Us
    </h1>
    <p style="color:#000;font-size: 30px;">
      AspectOS is an operating system created by AspectOS Studios. It started
      out as an individual project but has grown over time. Now we have a team
      of 35 people! Everybody is committed to making a superior OS. This doesn't
      tend to become a real operating system and is actually a realistic mock-up
      on

      <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>. The operating system was
      created in May 2021 and was released for BETA testing. At the time, there
      weren't a lot of apps, and was actually kind of boring. The UI didn't look
      good and some of the apps didn't function. So eventually, it was abandoned
      and wasn't touched again. Around 4 months later, AspectOS was back again!
      This time, with a team. The founder created a collaboration and many
      people joined on the first day! So we got to work and we are currently
      working on one of the best operating systems from scratch! From the most
      advanced apps, such as our
      <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/554613036/">weather app</a>
      to the most simplest apps such as our
      <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/516117934/"> clicker game</a>,
      we will make sure you have an experience like no other. As we said, we
      have many people but more are sure to come and more are sure to have great
      suggestions for our operating system. Below is AspectOS Legacy and what it
      looked like before we had a team of excellent programmers.
