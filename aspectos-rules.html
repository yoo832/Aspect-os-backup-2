    Thank you for reading such important information. AspectOS has a community
    full of wonderful people but sometimes, things can get crazy. Such as hate
    and/or spam. And we don't allow both of those. So we have laid some ground
    rules on what we expect for Aspect. If you do not agree to these terms, stop
    using AspectOS, AspectOS Jr., or AspectOS Pro.
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>WARNING:</b> These are the rules for users. If you want to apply for
    AspectOS or are working for AspectOS, then read the

  <h2 id="What we Expect" class="the-rules-header2">
    What we Expect
  </h2>
  <p class="the-rules-paragraph1">
    We expect that you follow all rules that are displayed over here. To
    simplify this, do not hate on anybody and do not hate on AspectOS. Doing
    this will get you reported. We accept <u>constructive</u> criticism. This
    will help improve quality for AspectOS. We do not accept hate and harsh
    criticism. Doing this will <u>not</u> get your idea added. We believe that
    hate isn't always the answer to everything.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h2 id="Ideas" class="the-rules-header2">
    Ideas
  </h2>
  <p class="the-rules-paragraph1">
    Here at AspectOS, we sometimes struggle with new ideas. So we let the
    community give ideas to us. But we only accept ideas that are friendly to
    the community. What does this mean? This means that you shouldn't give ideas
    that encourages negative things. If you want to suggest an Idea to Aspect to
    implement in AspectOS, you need to know what we don't allow. Please read our
    <a href="https://aspectos.glitch.me/community-guidelines.html"
      >Community Guidelines</a

    to see what and what we don't allow.

    We do not collect your data according to our
    <a href="https://aspectos.glitch.me/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>
    and we make sure that your data is safe. But there are people on the

  <h2 id="spam" class="the-rules-header2">
    Spamming
  </h2>
  <p class="the-rules-paragraph1">
    On our Official AspectOS Forum, we get a lot of off-topic things and we get
    spam. We do not encourage spam. Please do not spam our websites. Doing this
    makes the website unresponsive and we will have to fix it which will take a
    while. If you proceed to spam, we will report you on Scratch or temporarily
    disable your account. If the spam continues, we will have to possibly ban
    your account
  </p>
  <br />
  <h2 id="bans and warnings" class="the-rules-header2">
    Warnings
  </h2>
  <p class="the-rules-paragraph1">
    We have a strict system and if you break our rules, we will have to give you
    a warning. Of course some warnings will be temporary but some could be
    permanent if rules are broken constantly. Please review our
    <a href="https://aspectos.glitch.me/community-guidelines.html"
      >Community Guidelines</a
    >
    to prevent from this happening to you. Below is displaying how our warning
    system works. It starts off with a simple warning but more disipline is put
    into it every time. These are warnings if you do it on a daily basis. If you
    accidently violated the rules, you will just get a warning.

    These violations only count against you if you have signed up for an
    account. People who do not sign in cannot access forums which means that
    these violations don't apply to them.
  </p>

  <h2 id="Account" class="the-rules-paragraph1">
    Accounts
  </h2>
  <p class="the-rules-paragraph1">
    These rules take effect in 2022. That same year, we will add a login system.
    That means users will be able to create an account with their own username
    and password. When an account is created, people will be able to go on the
    forums and talk to each other about bugs. They will also be able to save
    their changes for the website (Between Light and Dark Mode). Do not abuse
    accounts in anyway. Do not share your password with any others. Do not try
    to hack accounts. Doing this will get your account terminated. Do not fight
    with other accounts. We do not accept wild fighting and we will mute you if
    you enter a fight on the website.
