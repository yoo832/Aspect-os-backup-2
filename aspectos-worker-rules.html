    Aspect Worker Rules
  </h1>

  <p>
    Thank you for reading the AspectOS Worker Rules. If you are reading this,
    then you are either applying to work at AspectOS or you are a curious
    person. Either way, you should know how the AspectOS Team acts.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
<h2 class="worker-rules-header1">
  Requirements
  </h2>
  <p class="worker-rules-paragraph">
    Before you join AspectOS, you need to know what requirements you need to
    join. We need experienced coders with at least 5 months of knowledge. We
    want people to have a Scratch account so we can easily contact them. We want
    people to contribute to the project at all times. Doing all of this
    increases your chances of getting accepted.
  </p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <h2 class="worker-rules-header2">
    Fighting
  </h2>
  <p class="worker-rules-paragraph">
    Fighting is prohibited when working at AspectOS. We want everybody to work
    with each other and have a peaceful workspace. Fighting does give you a
    warning and enough warnings will get you fired from AspectOS. Do not argue
    with other workers, do not argue with the creator of AspectOS, do not argue
    with any partners of AspectOS, and do not argue with any other operating
    systems.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2 class="worker-rules-header2">
    Plagiarism
  </h2>
  <p class="worker-rules-paragraph">
    <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/GAMS2/">GAMS2</a> had an agreement
    with the creator on October of 2021 stating that people cannot take other
    peoples tasks,
    this was due to the large majority of workers attempting to take over GAMS2's Command Prompt. 
    That agreement has been in effect ever since. 
    We do not encourage plagiarising and you will get a warning for taking somebody else's
    task. That way, everybody has their own tasks and it's fair for everybody.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2 class="worker-rules-header2">
    Patience
  </h2>
  <p class="worker-rules-paragraph">
    Sometimes, we have no tasks open to do. That is a good thing and you should
    not get mad because you didn't get a task. We have many updates to come in
    the future and you will be able to do a task then. Do not take a task if the to-do list is taken. Being patient is the best thing to do when you have no task.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2 class="worker-rules-header2">
    Independence
  </h2>
  <p class="worker-rules-paragraph">
    When you suggest an idea, it is best that you do it instead of someone else.
    When you think of a feature, you have to think on how it works and you have
    to code the feature because it's something you thought. We do this because
    we cannot read minds and so sometimes, we cannot understand what features
    are being discussed.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2 class="worker-rules-header2">
    Going off-topic
  </h2>
  <p class="worker-rules-paragraph">
    Aspect is committed to making an OS but sometimes, our workers can act foolish. We do not encourage off-topic posts that are just one word and does not relate to the OS in any way. Doing this will get you a warning. If it isn't related to the work, don't post it. Off-topic posts also includes spamming, random images, fighting, talking about some part of your life like going to sleep without a reason related to Aspect, repeatedly reposting something unless it's been 4 days since that post, memes, and much more things related to that.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2 class="worker-rules-header2">
    Scratch CG
  </h2>
  <p class="worker-rules-paragraph">
    Every creation that is presented for Aspect use has to follow the Scratch Community Guidelines. If it doesn't follow the guidelines, then do not share it to Aspect. We want to create a creative OS, but we also want to follow rules and not get in trouble. What you do affects the Aspect Company.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2 class="worker-rules-header2">
    Resignation
  </h2>
  <p class="worker-rules-paragraph">
    At any time, you can quit the Aspect company for any reason. We will not force you to stay in the company. We can also terminate your employment if certain rules are broken. If any of the rules stated in this page, the AspectOS rules, and the Community Guidelines are violated, we will give you warnings and possibly give you strikes.
