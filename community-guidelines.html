    Community Guidelines
  </h1>
<p class="CG-Paragraph">
  Thank you for reading the AspectOS Community Guidelines. We have made these guidelines to make sure everybody stays safe and friendly on the Internet. Here we have composed a list of what you should and shouldn't do here at AspectOS. But first let's go over the basics. The things that every Community Guidelines has. 
  </p>
  
  <h2 class="CG-Header2">
    Keep the Site Friendly
  </h2>
  <p class="CG-Paragraph">
    We welcome people of all ages to come and talk to each other. We want to keep the site friendly for all ages. We do not recommend posting mature content. When you are about to post something think about one thing. "Is this appropriate for all ages?"
  </p>
  
  <h2 class="CG-Header2">
    Stay Safe
  </h2>
  <p class="CG-Paragraph">
    Because we have moderating forums (coming soon), we have people chat with each other to ask and answer questions. Be careful though. You can't trust people on the Internet. Do not click external links that you think are suspicious. If you think a link is malicious, report it to AspectOS and we will get rid of it ASAP. We also advise you to not tell anyone where you live or who you are. People on the Internet aren't who they really are in real life.
  </p>
  
  <h2 class="CG-Header2">
    Work Together
  </h2>
  <p class="CG-Paragraph">
    When a problem occurs, we want everybody to stay calm and to stay safe. We want everybody to work together so that problems don't occur and/or a problem with the website gets bigger. If a problem happens, do not interact with any problem. Doing this will get your account terminated
  </p>
  
  <h2 class="CG-Header2">
    Do's and Dont's
  </h2>
  <p class="CG-Paragraph">
    We accept ideas big and small to improve stuff. We also let people talk on the forums for AspectOS. We do have some rules to this though.
