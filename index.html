      The page should redirect soon. If this is taking a while, refresh the
      page, or contact @AIGamesDeveloper.

      Fun fact, This used to be the landing page, but it was moved due to issues
      with folders (I'm assuming). Also, there is no way your able to read this
      unless you got stuck. So.... if you did, maybe reload, or contact the
      above, preferably @AIGamesDeveloper. If you were able to read that WHILE
      it was redirecting and wasn't broken, good job!! Just so you know, this will slowly get harder to read. Haha.
