      Welcome to the Official Aspect Website! This website is for people who
      want to learn about AspectOS. This website also covers past and future
      updates for our OS. Before I get into the details, you need to know who we
      are and what we do.

      About Us
    </h1>
    <p style="color:#ededed;font-size: 30px;">
      AspectOS is an operating system created by Aspect Studios. It started out
      as an individual project but has grown over time. Now we have a team of 35
      people! Everybody is committed to making a superior OS. This doesn't tend
      to become a real operating system and is actually a realistic mock-up on

      <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>. The operating system was
      created in May of 2021 and was released for BETA testing. At the time,
      there weren't a lot of apps, and was actually kind of boring. The UI
      didn't look good and some of the apps didn't function. So eventually, it
      was abandoned and wasn't touched again. Around 4 months later, AspectOS
      was back again! This time, with a team. The founder created a collab and
      many people joined on the first day! So we got to work and we are
      currently working on one of the best operating systems from scratch! From
      the most advanced apps, such as our<a href= "https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/554613036/">weather app</a>
      to the most simplest apps such as our
      <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/516117934/">
    clicker game,</a> we will make sure you have the best experience like no other. As we said, we
      have many people but more are sure to come and more are sure to have great
      suggestions for our operating system. Below is AspectOS Legacy and what it
      looked like before we had a team of excellent programmers.
