     About Us
    </h1>
    <p style="color:White;">
    AspectOS is an operating system created by Aspect Studios. It started out as an individual project but has grown over time. Now we have a team of 25 people! Everybody is committed to making a superior OS. This doesn't tend to become a real operating system and is actually a realistic mock-up on scratch.mit.edu. The operating system was created in May of 2021 and was released for BETA testing. At the time, there weren't a lot of apps, and was actually kind of boring. The UI didn't look good and some of the apps didn't function. So eventually, it was abandoned and wasn't touched again. Around 4 months later, AspectOS was back again! This time, with a team. The founder created a collab and many people joined on the first day! So we got to work and we are currently working on one of the best operating systems from scratch!
