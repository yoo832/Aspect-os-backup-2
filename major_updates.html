  <section class="features">A Big Introduction</section>

  <p id = "bigtext">
    AspectOS is releasing to the public with a lot of features being displayed.
    Let's go over the most important features, big and small.
  </p>

  <h1>
    Advanced Apps
  </h1>

  <p id = "bigtext">
    The biggest thing for AspectOS are the apps imported from Replit. Replit is
    a programming site where you can learn popular languages such as HTML and
    JS. Many of our workers have made so many Repls and it's spectacular how
    they have done this. One of our apps, the weather app, displays real weather
    for most cities. This makes the operating system feel more realistic to the
    user. Adding to that, we have a notification system like no other on
    scratch. This notification system displays any text you want using
    variables. This is useful for our app library. We also have a command prompt
    as well with operating features. And much more! Our developers are committed
    to making advanced apps for you
    
  </p>

  <h1>
    Games
  </h1>

  <p id = "bigtext">
    For Appspect, we have some games coming to version 1.0 such as a platformer
    game and a clicker game. We also have an archery game as well with mobile
    compatibility. The platformer game currently doesn't support mobile
    compatibility and will be added for 1.1 as well as other games.
  </p>

  <h1>
    Designs
  </h1>

  <p id = "bigtext">
    AspectOS delivers a modern design that meets the eye. We have a dark theme
    for users who prefer dark over light and we have a selection of wallpapers
    to choose from. We have designs for over 20 apps and we have an incredible
    UI! Many things might be blurry due to the fact that they were made with a
    pen extension. But we are improving our quality. We are also making a sleek
    UI for the camera app so you can look like our UI. Fabulous!
  </p>

  <h1>
    Appspect
  </h1>

  <p id = "bigtext">
    Coming to 1.0 is Appspect, an app store for AspectOS. It will bring many
    apps on the release date and we have a decent design for it. We have a
    weekly page, a daily page, and a trending page! Most of them might use cloud
    variables and cloud variables are limited. But we are trying our best. Apps
    coming to Appspect including:

    <br style = "text-align: center;" id = "bigtext">Many more are to come in future updates. And we mean a lot more. We are excited to share so many features with you in the future!
  
  
  <h1>
   That's All! 
  </h1>
  
  <p>
    This is 1.0 so not many updates will be shared. But that's all for now! Thanks for reading this piece of text and this will update when 1.1 comes out this will be in a seperate page (not in the navigation bar)
