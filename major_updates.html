  <section class="features">A Big Introduction</section>
  
  <p>
  AspectOS is releasing to the public with a lot of features being displayed. Let's go over the most important features, big and small.
  </p>
  
  <h1>
    Advanced Apps
  </h1>
  

  <p>
    The biggest thing for AspectOS are the apps imported from Replit. Replit is a programming site where you can learn popular languages such as HTML and JS. Many of our workers have made so many Repls and it's spectacular how they have done this. One of our apps, the weather app, displays real weather for most cities. This makes the operating system feel more realistic to the user. Adding to that, we have a notification system like no other on scratch. This notification system displays any text you want using variables. This is useful for our app library. We also have a command prompt as well with operating features. And much more! Our developers are committed to making advanced apps for you!
  </p>
  
  <h1>
    Games
  </h1>

  <p>
    For Appspect, we have some games coming to version 1.0 such as a platformer game and a clicker game. We also have an archery game as well with mobile compatibility. The platformer game currently doesn't support mobile compatibility and will be added for 1.1 as well as other games.
